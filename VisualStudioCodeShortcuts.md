# Visual Studio Code Shortcuts

When navigating files in VSCode's Explorer using arrow keys
- `Enter` will open the file and set it to _Keep Open_ (equivalent to double click).
  A file can be set to keep open by `Ctrl + K, Enter`, or right-clicking the tab and clicking Keep Open.
- `Space` will preview the file (_Preview Mode_). Previewing a different file will close this file's preview. (equivalent to single click)
