## Code Snippets

Code snippets are small blocks of reusable code that can be inserted into a code file.
Visual Studio has built-in code snippets that can be generated by typing in the associated shortcut.
This while either generate the code and pushing `enter` or `tab`.

| Shortcut                  | Description                                |
| ---                       | ---                                        |
| `ctor`                    | Create a constructor                       |
| `prop`                    | Create a property                          |
| `propg`                   | Create a private setter property           |
| `forr`                    | Create a decrementing for loop             |
| `\\\`                     | Generate comment template for member       |

## Comment Tokens

These are tokens used in a comment that allows them to be easily found. These tokens should be used with a message so you know what was intended to be conveyed.

In Rider current tokens in the solution can be found by View > Tool Windows > TODO
