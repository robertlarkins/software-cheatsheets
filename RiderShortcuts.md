## Code Snippets

Code snippets are small blocks of reusable code that can be inserted into a code file.
Visual Studio has built-in code snippets that can be generated by typing in the associated shortcut.
This while either generate the code and pushing `enter` or `tab`.

| Shortcut                  | Description                                |
| ---                       | ---                                        |
| `ctor`                    | Create a constructor                       |
| `prop`                    | Create a property                          |
| `propg`                   | Create a private setter property           |
| `forr`                    | Create a decrementing for loop             |
| `\\\`                     | Generate comment template for member       |
